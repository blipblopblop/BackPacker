**Directions via Path Finding:** Devloped an algorithm to find and report travel directions via shortest path between nodes in a graph. Note that supprting documents contian helper functions

**TravellingSalesman:** Developed an algorithm to tackle the travelling sales man optimization problem though findind a valid path through a graph that passes through a set of vertices.

** Note the repository only contains selected code highlighting use of the necessary algorithms employed
